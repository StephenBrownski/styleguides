JS StyleGuide - Tools
=====================

## Text Editor / IDE

The text editor or IDE you use is your choice, but consider using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3), a cross-platform, extensible plain text editor. Favour text editors which have a small learning curve, get out of the way, and have a rich set of languages for syntax highlighting.

## Development Browser

Favor using the latest Google Chrome or Firefox browsers for development. The rollout of ECMAScript language features is ongoing and each of these browsers continue to incorporate these features on a regular basis.

The developer tools in each of these browsers are also excellent.  Use them to help debug your scripts and explore the DOM when developing.

## Libraries

* Use jQuery when necessary, it should not be *the* solution for writing JavaScript
* Handlebars should be used for HTML templates
* Jasmine should be used for writing unit tests
* Use additional libraries for development as needed
